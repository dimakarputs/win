Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three.
Strange thingsdid happen here
No stranger would itbe
Ifwe met up at midnight in the tree.

Are you, areyou
Coming to the tree
the deadmancalledoutfor his loveto flee.

StrangethingsdidhappenhereNostranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

Are you, areyou
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

Are you,

a necklaceofhope, sidebysidewith me
